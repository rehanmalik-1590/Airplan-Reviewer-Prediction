📋 Introduction
This project focuses on predicting airline customer satisfaction using machine learning techniques. The analysis includes comprehensive data exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, and building predictive models to classify whether a passenger is satisfied or not based on various service attributes such as seat comfort, inflight entertainment, food quality, and flight delays.

✨ Features
📊 Comprehensive Data Analysis: Exploratory data analysis with visualizations

🧹 Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling

🔍 Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful features from raw data

🤖 Multiple ML Models: Implementation of various classification algorithms

📈 Performance Evaluation: Detailed model comparison with multiple metrics

🎯 Visualization: Clear visual representations of data patterns and model performance
